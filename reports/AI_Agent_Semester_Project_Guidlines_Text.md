# AI Agent Semester Project Guidelines

**Project Type:** AI Agent Design & Implementation
**Instructor:** Dr. Irfana Bibi
**Due Date:** 15th December 2025

## 1. Project Overview
In this semester project, you will design and implement an AI-based intelligent agent that interacts with data, performs reasoning, and generates meaningful outputs.

Your project must demonstrate:
* AI reasoning or decision-making
* Data processing or retrieval
* Automation of tasks
* Logging or storage of results
* Evaluation or validation of outputs

**Examples of acceptable agent systems include:**
* Recommendation Agent (Selected)

## 2. Requirements

**A. Data Source / Dataset**
* Retrieve/load data from at least one source (CSV/DB).
* Support at least 3 types of queries.

**B. Reasoning or Analytics Features**
Must implement at least **four (4)**. **Agent Memory is mandatory.**
1.  **Agent Memory** (Conversation or Long-term Memory Integration) (Mandatory)
2.  Summarization
3.  Classification or Categorization
4.  Pattern Detection
5.  Anomaly Detection
6.  Trend Analysis
7.  Recommendation System
8.  Gap Identification
9.  Scoring or Ranking
10. Rule-based Decision-making
11. LLM-based Explanation / Analysis

**C. Database / Storage Component**
Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to store:
* Logs
* Outputs or reports
* User queries
* Agent decisions
* Metadata or summaries

**D. Validation Layer (Pydantic Models)**
* All major outputs must pass through Pydantic validation.
* **At least two Pydantic models are required.**

**E. User Interface**
* Streamlit, Web API, or Chat-style interface.

## 3. Deliverables
* Source Code Folder (`src`, `data`, `database`, `models`, `ui`).
* Technical Report (10-15 pages).
* Presentation Slides.
* Live Demo.

## 4. Evaluation Rubric
* Functionality: 30
* AI Analysis: 10
* DB Logging: 10
* Code Quality: 10
* Innovation: 5
* UI: 5
* Presentation: 10
* Report: 20

## 6. Optional Bonus Features
* Semantic search with embeddings.
* Interactive chat interface with conversation memory.
* Trend/citation graphs.
* Multi-agent collaboration.
